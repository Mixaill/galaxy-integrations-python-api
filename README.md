# GOG Galaxy Integrations Python API

This Python library allows to easily build community integrations for various gaming platforms with GOG Galaxy 2.0.

- refer to our <a href='https://galaxy-integrations-python-api.readthedocs.io'>documentation</a>

## Features

Each integration in GOG Galaxy 2.0 comes as a separate Python script, and is launched as a separate process, that which needs to communicate with main instance of GOG Galaxy 2.0.

The provided features are:

- multistep authorisation using a browser built into GOG Galaxy 2.0
- support for GOG Galaxy 2.0 features:
    - importing owned and detecting installed games
    - installing and launching games
    - importing achievements and game time
    - importing friends lists and statuses
    - importing friends recomendations list
    - receiving and sending chat messages
- cache storage

## Platform Id's

Each integration can implement only one platform. Each integration must declare which platform it's integrating.

[List of possible Platofrm IDs](PLATFORM_IDs.md)

## Basic usage

Eeach integration should inherit from the :class:`~galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin` class. Supported methods like :meth:`~galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.get_owned_games` should be overwritten - they are called from the GOG Galaxy client in the appropriate times.
Each of those method can raise exceptions inherited from the :exc:`~galaxy.api.jsonrpc.ApplicationError`.
Communication between an integration and the client is also possible with the use of notifications, for example: :meth:`~galaxy.api.plugin.Plugin.update_local_game_status`.

```python
import sys
from galaxy.api.plugin import Plugin, create_and_run_plugin
from galaxy.api.consts import Platform

class PluginExample(Plugin):
    def __init__(self, reader, writer, token):
        super().__init__(
            Platform.Generic, # Choose platform from available list
            "0.1", # Version
            reader,
            writer,
            token
        )

    # implement methods
    async def authenticate(self, stored_credentials=None):
        pass

def main():
    create_and_run_plugin(PluginExample, sys.argv)

# run plugin event loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Deployment

The client has a built-in Python 3.7 interpreter, so the integrations are delivered as python modules.
In order to be found by GOG Galaxy 2.0 an integration folder should be placed in [lookup directory](#deploy-location). Beside all the python files, the integration folder has to contain [manifest.json](#deploy-manifest) and all third-party dependencies. See an [examplary structure](#deploy-structure-example).

### Lookup directory
<a name="deploy-location"></a>
- Windows:

    `%localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`

- macOS:

    `~/Library/Application Support/GOG.com/Galaxy/plugins/installed`

### Manifest
<a name="deploy-manifest"></a> 
Obligatory JSON file to be placed in a integration folder.

```json
{
    "name": "Example plugin",
    "platform": "generic",
    "guid": "UNIQUE-GUID",
    "version": "0.1",
    "description": "Example plugin",
    "author": "Name",
    "email": "author@email.com",
    "url": "https://github.com/user/galaxy-plugin-example",
    "script": "plugin.py"
}
```
| property      | description |
|---------------|---|
| `guid`        |   |
| `description` |   |
| `url`         |   |
| `script`      | path of the entry point module, relative to the integration folder |

### Dependencies
All third-party packages (packages not included in Python 3.7 standard library) should be deployed along with plugin files. Use the folowing command structure:

```pip install DEP --target DIR --implementation cp --python-version 37 --only-binary=:all: --platform=win32```

For example plugin that uses *requests* has structure as follows:

<a name="deploy-structure-example"></a>
```bash
installed
└── my_integration
    ├── galaxy
    │   └── api
    ├── requests
    │   └── ...
    ├── plugin.py
    └── manifest.json
```
